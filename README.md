**Java Annotations Exercises**

This repository provides practical exercises exploring Java's Annotations, covering both built-in types and the creation and application of Custom Annotations. 
These examples highlight how annotations provide valuable metadata and enable powerful runtime processing.

You'll explore fundamental annotations like @Override, understanding its use in ensuring correct method overriding within class hierarchies (e.g., Worker and its subclasses for salary calculations). 
You'll also learn to mark methods as obsolete using @Deprecated and how to suppress associated warnings with @SuppressWarnings("deprecation").

Beyond built-in annotations, the exercises delve into creating and processing your own Custom Annotations at runtime using Java Reflection. 

This includes defining annotations like @JsonSerializable by specifying their @Target (e.g., for classes) and @Retention (e.g., for runtime availability). 
You'll then see how Reflection is used to detect these custom annotations on classes and extract their parameters. 
A practical example demonstrates how a custom annotation can drive object serialization (e.g., converting a Song object to JSON), showcasing metadata-driven functionalities often seen in frameworks and libraries.
